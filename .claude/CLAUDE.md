## 📋 Architecture at a Glance (3 minutes)

```
1. DATA PIPELINE (data_pipeline.py)
   WebSocket ticks → 1-min OHLCV bars + VWAP calculation

2. SWING DETECTION (swing_detector.py)
   Watch-based system: bars confirm past turning points
   Output: swing_candidates dict (all detected swings)

3. STRIKE FILTRATION (continuous_filter.py)
   Stage-1: Static filters (price range 100-300 Rs, VWAP ≥4%)
   Stage-2: Dynamic filter (SL% 2-10%, recalculated every bar)
   Stage-3: Tie-breaker (select best strike per option type)
   Output: current_best dict (qualified strikes for CE and PE)

4. ORDER EXECUTION (order_manager.py)
   Proactive placement: SL orders (trigger: swing_low - tick, limit: trigger - 3)
   Position sizing: R_VALUE formula (₹6,500 per position)
   Exit SL: SL orders at highest_high + 1 (trigger), +3 Rs buffer (limit)

5. POSITION TRACKING (position_tracker.py)
   Monitor active positions, calculate R-multiples
   Daily exit at +/-5R or 3:15 PM force close
```

## Architecture: Continuous Filtering (Proactive Order Management)

**Key Innovation:** Orders are placed BEFORE swing breaks, not after.

```
Flow:
1. Swing LOW detected → Added to candidates (static filter: 100-300 Rs)
2. EVERY BAR: Evaluate ALL candidates (dynamic filters: VWAP 4%+, SL 2-10%)
3. Track best CE and best PE separately
4. Best strike qualifies → Place SL order (trigger: swing_low - tick, limit: trigger - 3)
5. Price drops to trigger → Order activates → Fills at limit price (no slippage)
```

## Swing Detection Logic

The swing detector uses a **watch-based system** - a confirmation-voting mechanism where future bars validate past turning points.

### Core Concept

A **swing** is a significant turning point where trends change:
- **Swing Low**: A local minimum - price makes a low, then moves higher
- **Swing High**: A local maximum - price makes a high, then moves lower

### Watch-Based Confirmation System

Each bar in history gets **watch counters** that increment when future bars confirm it might be a turning point:

**For Swing LOW Detection:**
- A bar's `low_watch` counter increments when a future bar shows:
  1. **Higher High** AND
  2. **Higher Close**
- Logic: If price makes higher highs/closes vs a past bar, that bar was likely a low point

**For Swing HIGH Detection:**
- A bar's `high_watch` counter increments when a future bar shows:
  1. **Lower Low** AND
  2. **Lower Close**
- Logic: If price makes lower lows/closes vs a past bar, that bar was likely a high point

### Trigger Rule

When any bar's watch counter reaches **2**:
- **For low_watch = 2**: Find the **lowest low** in the window → Mark as **SWING LOW**
- **For high_watch = 2**: Find the **highest high** in the window → Mark as **SWING HIGH**

**Why "2"?** One confirmation could be noise. Two confirmations validate the turning point.

### Alternating Pattern

Valid swings must alternate:
```
High → Low → High → Low → High → Low
```

After a swing low, the next swing must be a high. After a high, the next must be a low.

### Swing Updates (Same Direction)

If a **new extreme** forms BEFORE the next alternating swing:
- **Swing LOW @ 80** detected
- Before any HIGH, price drops to **75** (new lower low)
- **Action**: UPDATE the swing low from 80 → 75
- **Reason**: 75 is the true extreme, not the premature 80

This ensures we always track the TRUE extremes, not intermediate levels.

### Window Behavior

- **First swing**: From start of data to current bar
- **Subsequent swings**: From bar AFTER last swing to current bar

This keeps the analysis focused on current wave formation only.

**Validation:** Watch-based system validated through historical testing

---

## Strike Filtration Logic

Strike filtration is the process of evaluating swing candidates to determine which options qualify for order placement. This happens **AFTER swing detection** but **BEFORE order execution**.

The system uses a **two-stage approach**: Static filters (run once) and Dynamic filters (run continuously).

### Stage 1: Static Filter (Run Once)

Applied **immediately when swing forms**, never rechecked.

**Criteria:**

1. **Price Range**
   - Rule: `MIN_ENTRY_PRICE ≤ Entry Price ≤ MAX_ENTRY_PRICE`
   - Entry Price = Swing Low (the option premium at swing formation)
   - Default: 100-300 Rs range

2. **VWAP Premium**
   - Rule: `VWAP Premium ≥ MIN_VWAP_PREMIUM` (4% by default)
   - Formula: `((Entry - VWAP) / VWAP) × 100`
   - VWAP is frozen at swing formation time (immutable)

**When Applied:**
```
Swing forms → Check price range → Check VWAP premium
    ↓
Pass both → Add to swing_candidates (static pool)
Fail either → Log rejection, discard swing
```

### Stage 2: Dynamic Filter (Run Every Bar/Tick)

Applied **every time new 1-min bar arrives** to all candidates in `swing_candidates`.

**SL% Filter (Truly Dynamic):**
- Rule: `MIN_SL_PERCENT ≤ SL% ≤ MAX_SL_PERCENT` (2-10% by default)
- Formula:
  ```
  Highest High = Maximum high since swing formation
  Entry Price = Swing low
  SL Price = Highest High + 1 Rs (buffer for slippage)
  SL% = (SL Price - Entry Price) / Entry Price × 100
  ```

**Why SL% is Dynamic:**
- Highest High updates every bar (price action continues)
- SL% can change from passing → failing
- Example: Bar 1: SL%=4.6% ✓ → Bar 3: SL%=12.3% ❌ (exceeds 10% limit)

**Real-Time Evaluation:**
- Evaluate every tick/bar (not just every 10 seconds)
- Ensures SL% reflects true risk at order placement moment

### Stage 3: Tie-Breaker (Best Strike Selection)

When **multiple strikes pass all filters** for the same option type (CE or PE), select ONE using:

**Rule 1: SL Points Closest to 10 Rs**
- Target: 10 points (optimized for R_VALUE = ₹6,500)
- Formula: `sl_distance = abs(sl_points - 10)`
- Example: 8pts (distance=2), 12pts (distance=2), 9pts (distance=1) ← **BEST**

**Rule 2: Highest Entry Price (if tied on Rule 1)**
- If SL distance is same, prefer higher premium

### Filter State Tracking

**swing_candidates (dict):**
- All swings that passed static filters (price range + VWAP premium)
- Never re-evaluated after insertion
- Only swings in this pool are eligible for dynamic SL% filtering

**qualified_candidates (list):**
- Swings from `swing_candidates` that currently pass dynamic SL% filter
- Refreshed every tick/bar (mutable)

**current_best (dict):**
- The single best strike per option type (CE/PE) selected from qualified_candidates
- Eligible for order placement
- Updated every evaluation cycle

### Filter Flow Example

**Time: 10:15 AM - New Swing Detected**
```
Swing: NIFTY06JAN2626250CE @ 125.00 (swing low)
VWAP: 118.00

Step 1: Static Filter
- Check: 100 ≤ 125 ≤ 300 ✓ PASS
- Premium: (125-118)/118 = 5.93% ✓ PASS (≥4%)
- Action: Add to swing_candidates

Step 2: Dynamic Filter (10:15 AM)
- Highest High: 130.00
- SL Price: 131 (includes +1 Rs buffer)
- SL%: (131-125)/125 = 4.8% ✓ PASS (2-10%)
- Action: Add to qualified_candidates

Step 3: Tie-Breaker
- Only one CE qualified → Automatically best
```

**Evolution Over Time:**
- 10:20 AM: SL% = 8.8% ✓ Still qualified
- 10:30 AM: SL% = 12.0% ❌ DISQUALIFIED (exceeds 10%)

---

## Order Flow

### Core Concept: Proactive vs Reactive

**Reactive Approach (Legacy):**
```
1. Swing low breaks (price < swing_low)
2. System detects break
3. Place MARKET order
4. Get filled at current price (slippage!)
```

**Proactive Approach (Current - What We Do):**
```
1. Swing low detected and qualified
2. Place SL order BEFORE break:
   - Trigger: swing_low - tick_size (e.g., swing_low - 0.05)
   - Limit: trigger - 3 Rs (buffer for fill)
3. Order sits dormant until trigger hit
4. When price drops to trigger → Order activates as limit order
5. Fills at limit price with no slippage!
```

### Order Placement Trigger

Orders are placed only when a strike passes all three filter stages:

1. **Stage-1 (Static)**: Price range + VWAP premium ✓
2. **Stage-2 (Dynamic)**: SL% within limits ✓
3. **Stage-3 (Tie-Breaker)**: Selected as best strike per option type ✓

Plus position availability checks (max positions, no duplicate orders)

### Entry Order: SL (Stop-Limit)

```python
# When strike qualifies:
tick_size = 0.05
trigger_price = swing_low - tick_size      # Trigger just below swing
limit_price = trigger_price - 3            # 3 Rs buffer for fill

order = client.placeorder(
    strategy="baseline_v1",
    symbol="NIFTY30DEC2526000CE",
    action="SELL",              # Short the option
    exchange="NFO",
    price_type="SL",            # Stop-Limit order
    trigger_price=trigger_price,
    price=limit_price,
    quantity=lots * LOT_SIZE,
    product="MIS"               # Intraday
)
```

**Why SL (Stop-Limit), not regular LIMIT?**
- Order sits dormant until trigger price is hit
- Prevents fills if price never reaches our entry level
- When triggered, becomes a limit order with price control
- Better entry timing aligned with swing break

**Price Calculation:**
- `trigger_price = swing_low - 0.05` (1 tick below swing)
- `limit_price = trigger_price - 3` (3 Rs buffer below trigger)
- When price drops to trigger → Order activates → Fills at limit or better

### Position Sizing

Formula based on R_VALUE:

```
Risk per unit = Entry Price - SL Price
Required lots = R_VALUE / (Risk per unit × LOT_SIZE)
Final lots = min(Required lots, MAX_LOTS_PER_POSITION)
Final quantity = Final lots × LOT_SIZE

Example:
Entry: 150 Rs
SL: 160 Rs
Risk per unit: 10 Rs
Required lots: 6500 / (10 × 65) = 10 lots
Quantity: 10 × 65 = 650 shares
```

### Exit Stop Loss Order: SL (Placed on Fill)

```python
# SL placed IMMEDIATELY when entry fills:
trigger_price = highest_high + 1    # +1 Rs buffer above highest high
limit_price = trigger_price + 3     # +3 Rs buffer for fill

sl_order = client.placeorder(
    strategy="baseline_v1",
    symbol="NIFTY30DEC2526000CE",
    action="BUY",              # Close the short
    exchange="NFO",
    price_type="SL",           # Stop-Limit order
    trigger_price=trigger_price,
    price=limit_price,
    quantity=lots * LOT_SIZE,
    product="MIS"
)
```

**Why SL (Stop-Limit) instead of Market?**
- Market orders can have extreme slippage in fast markets
- SL with 3 Rs buffer ensures reasonable fill
- Better control over exit price

**+1 Rs Buffer in Trigger Calculation:**
- Accounts for tick-level slippage during volatile moves
- Prevents premature exits at exact highest high level
- Ensures SL triggers reliably

### Order Lifecycle States

```
NO_ORDER → ORDER_PLACED → ORDER_FILLED → POSITION_ACTIVE → EXITED
   ↓           ↓              ↓               ↓             ↓
REJECTED   CANCELLED      SL_HIT         CLOSED        LOGGED
```

**State Transitions:**

1. **NO_ORDER → ORDER_PLACED**
   - Trigger: Strike passes all filters
   - Action: Place SL order (trigger: swing_low - tick, limit: trigger - 3)

2. **ORDER_PLACED → ORDER_FILLED**
   - Trigger: Order status = COMPLETE (checked every 10 seconds)
   - Action: Create position, place SL-L order immediately

3. **ORDER_PLACED → CANCELLED**
   - Triggers:
     - Disqualification (SL% > 10%)
     - Swing breaks before order fills
     - Different strike becomes best
     - Daily limits hit (+/-5R)
     - Market close (3:15 PM)

4. **POSITION_ACTIVE → EXITED**
   - Triggers: SL hit, target hit, or force exit
   - Action: Log trade with R-multiple

### Order Modification Rules

**When to Modify (keep same symbol):**
- Same symbol remains best candidate
- Swing low gets updated (e.g., 80 → 75)
- Modify order trigger/limit to: new_swing_low - tick, trigger - 3

**When to Cancel and Replace (different symbol):**
- Different strike becomes best
- Cancel old symbol's order
- Place new order for new symbol

### Important Rules

**Rule 1: Keep Orders Once Placed**
- Don't cancel just because price moves away from swing
- Only cancel if disqualified (SL% out of range) or better strike available

**Rule 2: One Order Per Option Type**
- Maximum one pending CE order
- Maximum one pending PE order
- Cancel old if new best strike selected

**Rule 3: Proactive Placement**
- Place orders BEFORE swing breaks
- Orders wait in market (not reactive after break)

## Common Tasks

### Check Why No Trades
Look at filter summary logs:
```
[FILTER-SUMMARY] 8 candidates, 0 qualified. Rejections: VWAP<4%=5, SL<2%=0
```
- `VWAP<4%`: Swing low price is below VWAP (need price 4%+ ABOVE VWAP)
- `SL<2%` or `SL>10%`: Stop loss percentage outside acceptable range

### Modify Entry Filters
Edit `config.py`:
```python
MIN_VWAP_PREMIUM = 0.04  # Reduce to 0.02 for more trades
```

### Check Swing Detection
The swing detector uses watch-based confirmation. If issues:
1. Check logs for `[SWING]` tags
2. Verify alternating pattern (High → Low → High → Low)

### Debug Data Pipeline
```python
# Check coverage in heartbeat logs:
[HEARTBEAT] Positions: 0 | Data: 22/22 | Coverage: 100.0% | Stale: 0
```

---

## Database Schema (live_state.db)

```sql
-- Positions table
positions (symbol, entry_price, quantity, sl_price, entry_time, status, pnl, r_multiple)

-- Orders table
orders (order_id, symbol, order_type, price, quantity, status, timestamp)

-- Daily summary
daily_summary (date, total_trades, winning_trades, cumulative_r, pnl)

-- Swing detection log
swing_log (symbol, swing_type, price, timestamp, vwap)
```

---

## Important Patterns

### Time Handling
Always use IST:
```python
import pytz
IST = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
now = datetime.now(IST)
```

### Symbol Format
```python
# Format: NIFTY[DDMMMYY][STRIKE][CE/PE]
symbol = f"NIFTY{expiry}{strike}CE"
# Example: NIFTY30DEC2526000CE
```

### Error Handling
- All broker calls have 3-retry logic with 2-second delay
- WebSocket auto-reconnects on disconnect
- State persists to SQLite (crash recovery)

### Logging
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("[TAG] Message")  # Use tags like [SWING], [ORDER], [FILL]
```

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never skip Analyzer Mode** - Always test with PAPER_TRADING=true first
2. **Position limits enforced** - Max 5 total, max 3 CE, max 3 PE
3. **Daily stops** - Auto-exit at +/-5R
4. **Force exit** - All positions closed at 3:15 PM
5. **Reconciliation** - Positions synced with broker every 60 seconds

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No ticks received | Check OpenAlgo WebSocket, broker login |
| All candidates rejected | Check VWAP filter (price must be 4%+ above VWAP) |
| Orders not placing | Verify API key, check order_manager logs |
| Swings not detecting | Compare with backtest logic, check bar formation |
| Position mismatch | Check reconciliation logs, verify broker dashboard |

## Code Change Guidelines

**When modifying core files:**
- `order_manager.py`
- `position_tracker.py`
- `baseline_v1_live.py`
- `continuous_filter.py`
- `swing_detector.py`
- `data_pipeline.py`

**Best Practices:**
1. Make minimal, focused changes
2. Don't refactor unrelated code
3. Keep changes small and testable
4. Verify system runs without errors after changes
5. Test in paper trading mode first

**Verification Steps:**
```bash
cd D:\nifty_options_agent

# 1. Run system check
python -m baseline_v1_live.check_system

# 2. Start in paper mode and verify no errors
python -m baseline_v1_live.baseline_v1_live --expiry 30JAN25 --atm 23500
```

Note: Automated tests will be added in future iterations.
